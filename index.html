            <p>My name is Juweek Adolphe and I like making creative code for the internet. I live in New York City and am currently a visual journalist at the Guardian. I'm taking on freelance projects right now; here's my resume.</p>

            <h3>The Guardian</h3>
            <p>I'm a visual journalist for The Guardian. I supply graphs and images to the newsroom, and code special content for the paper. While there, I covered the 2018 California wildfire season, the 2018 midterm elections, and the tobacco industry.

                - 2018 in wildfires: A look back
                - Tobacco's main power around the world
                - Why are California wildfires so destructive?
                - Black Radical Timeline: A look back
                - The children working the tobacco fields</p>
            </p>

            <h3>Barron's</h3>
            <p>Before The Guardian, I was under contract for Dow Jones Media, a media corporation that had finance-focused publications, like Barron's, Marketwatch, and Money-ish. I was a swiss knife for them, moving back and forth from editorial design and product design

            </p>

            <h3>Miscellani</h3>
            <p>I'm passionate about science and technology in general, and during my senior year in college, I helped start a satellite lab with some friends, and we ended up receiving grants from NASA and the Air Force. I'm really into anime, and I try to lead a zero-waste lifestyle.
