        <p>My name is Juweek Adolphe and I am a visual journalist for The Guardian. I live in New York City, but I'm from upstate NY and small town Georgia. I like working with data and coding things on the internet. Before, I was working at Barron's magazine, IBM, and a satellite lab. Here's my resume. I am available for freelance stuff.</p>
        <h4>The Guardian</h4>
        <p>I'm a visual journalist for The Guardian; that basically means I supply graphs and images to the newsroom, and code special content for the paper.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- 2018 in wildfires: A look back</li>
        <li>- Tobacco's global allies: world network of thinktanks</li>
          <li>- Stone Mountain: Is it time to take down the confederate monument?</li>
          <li>- Black Radical Timeline: A look back</li>
          <li>- The children working the tobacco fields</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Barron's</h4>
        <p>Before The Guardian, I was under contract for Dow Jones Media, a media corporation that had finance-focused publications, like Barron's, Marketwatch, and Money-ish. I was a swiss knife for them, moving back and forth from editorial design and product design</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Barron's homepage</li>
          <li>Barron's financial advisor map</li>
          <li>Paying for your college: 30 years ago v now</li>
          <li>Can you find your nearest Blockbuster?</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Miscellani</h4>
        <p>Before Barron's, I was a front end developer, and was an intern for IBM. During my senior year in college, I helped start a satellite lab with some friends, and we ended up receiving grants from NASA and the Air Force. I like anime, hip hop, and internet art. I care about the environment a lot.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Stop the Williams Pipeline</li>
          <li>Satellite lab</li>
        </ul>
